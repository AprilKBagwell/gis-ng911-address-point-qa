# NG911 Address Point Jurisdiction QA – Pleasant Grove, AL

## Project Overview
This project evaluates NG911 address point data for jurisdictional accuracy within the Pleasant Grove, Alabama PSAP boundary. The analysis focuses on identifying address points that fall outside the authoritative PSAP boundary, which may result in misrouting of emergency calls or response delays.

## Data Used
- NG911 Address Points (local government source)
- PSAP Jurisdiction Boundary
- Basemap layers for visual reference

## Methodology
Address points were spatially analyzed using **Select By Location** in ArcGIS Pro to identify features not contained within the PSAP boundary. Results were reviewed visually, validated against jurisdiction limits, and exported for documentation and reporting.

## Results
The analysis identified multiple address points located outside the PSAP jurisdiction boundary. These discrepancies indicate potential data maintenance or boundary alignment issues that should be reviewed prior to NG911 deployment or updates.
